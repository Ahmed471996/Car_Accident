## About the project 

In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms to accurately model Casualty Severity using data collected from Leeds City - UK for 2011. We will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data.

We also will try to use data visualization and exploration to get some insights about the dataset.

1st Road Class :A roads – major roads intended to provide large-scale transport links within or between areas. B roads – roads intended to connect different areas, and to feed traffic between A roads and smaller roads on the network.

All UK roads (excluding motorways) fall into the following 4 categories:

A roads – major roads intended to provide large-scale transport links within or between areas B roads – roads intended to connect different areas, and to feed traffic between A roads and smaller roads on the network classified unnumbered – smaller roads intended to connect together unclassified roads with A and B roads, and often linking a housing estate or a village to the rest of the network. Similar to ‘minor roads’ on an Ordnance Survey map and sometimes known unofficially as C roads unclassified – local roads intended for local traffic. The vast majority (60%) of roads in the UK fall within this category
